If we have a Parent class P
and there are few child classes which extend from the parent class say - C1 and C2

then we should be able to substitute child classes wherever we had the reference of child classes while creating a parent object

Eg - Parent p = new Child1();

we should be able to substitute Child2 with Child1

Parent p = new Child2();
