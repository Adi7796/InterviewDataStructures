This design pattern is used to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch.
This approach saves costly resources and time, especially when object creation is a heavy price
Eg - creating a db connection, making a network call, reading a large sized file etc
So we just execute this logic once and store it in an object
thereafter we keep cloning this object and then use those objects. this saves time and resources
